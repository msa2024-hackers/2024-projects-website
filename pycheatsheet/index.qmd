The Python Cheatsheet is a resource for implementing statistical concepts in Python. Concepts and code snippets are taken from lectures, the [IAA Foundations](https://iaa-faculty.github.io/statistical_foundations/) book. Custom implementations may also be provided for concepts that have no specific library implementations.
